INITIALINTENSITY 1

; optional volume to set music playback to (default is 0) volume is in decibals and can be negative or positive
; negative numbers reduce the volume and positive numbers increase the volume

; reverb can be either on or off. Default is OFF.
REVERB OFF

; specify the reverb Input Gain in decibels. The default value is 0. This value is a floating point value.
REVERBINGAIN 0.0

; specify the reverb Mix in decibels. The default value is -10.0. A value of 0 means 100 percent wet reverb 
; (no direct signal). This value is a floating point value.
REVERBMIX -10
; Specify reverb decay time, in milliseconds. The default value is 1000. This value is a floating point value.
REVERBTIME 1000

; Specify reverb RBTime value. Ratio of the high frequencies to the global reverb time. Unless very bright 
; reverbs are wanted, this should be set to a value less than 1. The default value is 0.001. This value is a 
; loating point value.
